## Projects

### Guardian Angel Project

"Guardian Angel" is dedicated to providing a secure and supportive environment for individuals seeking assistance with mental health challenges. We offer a comprehensive range of resources to any client addressing various issues, including but not limited to suicide prevention, depression, anxiety, and abuse.

Additionally, we provide a platform for Users to document their thoughts through journaling. Research has demonstrated that journaling can significantly enhance mental well-being, and we are confident that articulating one's thoughts and concerns can yield substantial benefits for mental health. Soak in the affirmations provided that pop up in each journal entry.

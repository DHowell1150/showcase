- Tools/Workflow: REST APIs, Git, Heroku, Wordpress

## Projects

### Guardian Angel Project
    "Guardian Angel" is dedicated to providing a secure and supportive environment for individuals seeking assistance with mental health challenges. We offer a comprehensive range of resources to any client addressing various issues, including but not limited to suicide prevention, depression, anxiety, and abuse.

    Additionally, we provide a platform for Users to document their thoughts through journaling. Research has demonstrated that journaling can significantly enhance mental well-being, and we are confident that articulating one's thoughts and concerns can yield substantial benefits for mental health. Soak in the affirmations provided that pop up in each journal entry.  


[Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKhWXwzs=/) is the best way to visually navigate through this project as our naming conventions for repos are...well, lets say we learned a lot. Here includes:
- MVP
- Stretch tech
- Wireframes
- Extensions
- Brain dumps



Repos:
- [Core Repo](https://github.com/Guardian-Angel-2405/FE_guardian_angel_2405.git) includes MVC of the project and the User database
- [Gratitude Entry API Repo](https://github.com/Guardian-Angel-2405/BE_JOURNAL_guardian_angel_2405.git) for the Core Repo to consume
- [BE Journal Repo, Sinatra](https://github.com/Guardian-Angel-2405/BE_API_guardian_angel_2405.git)




Personal Contributions 
- **Sinatra Microservice**  Who knew something so simple could end up being so much work.  We chose it for simplicity's sake and ended up doing more work than spinning up a rails project.  Turns out Rails Magic is a beautiful thing.  

Enjoyment Pieces:
- Mocks and stubs to decrease API requests

### Codesnacks
    This is CodeSnacks: where doom scrolling can productively be replaced with continued learning.

    This application is geared towards overwhelmed Turing students (a redundant statement perhaps) who can utilize their micro-moments by snacking on some snippets.  


    With several categories to choose from ranging from ruby language to interview questions, users can capitalize on any non-project time they might have and can review bite-sized, digestible prompts.

    So when you find yourself in a busy line or are procrastinating a project, instead of mindlessly scrolling, grab a CodeSnack or two and own your micro-moments.
